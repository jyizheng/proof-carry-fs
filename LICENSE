Source files in this code have different licenses, shown in the
respective files. All those created by me, Deepak Garg, are under the
MIT license. You are free to use the files individually under the
terms of their respective licenses. All files (except binaries)
without explicit licenses are in public domain, free from any
copyright and license.

The code as a whole, and any binaries created from it, are under GNU
General Public License version 2 or at your option any later
version. This is due to a dependency on the source file
nPatriciaTrie.h (not created by me) which is under that license. The

In addition, I allow you to link the source code against the OpenSSL
library, and any other standard libraries available on your operating
system. (This permission is necessary to create the binaries).
