# Size of log buffer in KB. This will be held in memory.
# If you do set the option NO_LOG_COMMIT, the log is flushed to disk after each opertion.
# In that case, you can keep this value small. If you do not set NO_LOG_COMMIT, the log
# is circularly overwritten in memory and committed on unmount. So allocate a large log.
# The value below makes a 32 KB log buffer, which good if NO_LOG_COMMIT is not set.
